        <h3>
            Jay Kim is an English artist who makes pop and indie music. I fell in love with his work when I first heard the flow of his songs and the themes he sings about. What he expresses comes from the heart and resonates with me. He inspires me because music would be my life if I could make music like that. His work ignites a flame in me to give it a try and share music that others might enjoy.

        <h3>
            Ao Jūmonji is a manga artist and writer I discovered during the pandemic. I love the illustrations of the landscapes and how the colors warp and blend, which is so satisfying to me. The attention to small details gives his work an otherworldly feeling that I often don't find in other shows. The art speaks for itself, inspiring me to create and to inspire others as I was inspired.

        <h3>
            David Laid is a fitness influencer who went viral for his incredible transformation. From being very skinny to becoming a bodybuilder, seeing his progress through film is both shocking and inspiring. He motivates me because I identify as being on the skinnier side, and while I do have muscle, I always strive for the best version of myself. If he can do it, why can't I?
